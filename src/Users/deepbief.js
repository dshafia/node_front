          <p1>This creative brief for Reebok is a good example from a customer focus standpoint. While itâ€™s shorter than many briefs, it does go into detail about the target audience.<br/> 
           It covers who they are and their life circumstances. Not to mention the top challenge they face and how the brand addresses that challenge.<br/>
           These are details copywriters, designers, and others involved in print ad creation find useful.
